# trayectories_2

## Data Loading and Transformation:

- The code starts by reading a dataset from a text file named "2trayectoria.txt" using `read.table`. The data is expected to have a header, and specific formatting like decimal points represented by commas.
- The data (`datos`) is then transposed using `t(datos)`. This suggests that each column in the original data represents a different time series.

## Data Preparation:

- It computes various dimensions and characteristics of the dataset, like the number of rows (`d`) and columns (`n`), and initializes a zero matrix `y` of size `d` rows and `n` columns.
- The data from `datos` is then restructured into this matrix `y`, separating time (`t`) and the corresponding values.

## Defining Functions for Analysis:

- Several functions (`A1`, `A2`, `A3`, `A12`, `A22`, `A32`, `fa`, `fs`, `fc`, `fb`) are defined. These functions seem to be part of a statistical or mathematical model, possibly related to time series analysis.
- The functions are designed to perform various summations and calculations based on the data in `y` and the time points in `t`.

## Plotting and Solving Equations:

- The `fb` function is plotted over an interval (0,1). This could be for visual analysis of the behavior of the function.
- The `rootSolve` library is used to find the roots of the `fb` function within the interval (0,1), which are stored in `b`. This indicates a search for specific values (roots) where `fb` equals zero.

## Parameter Estimation and Predictions:

- The code calculates various parameters (`auxA`, `auxC`, `auxS2`, `auxM`, `auxBeta`) based on the roots found and the defined functions.
- Several prediction functions (`mediapred`, `modapred`, `medianapred`, `cuantil5pred`, `cuantil95pred`, `mediacondpred`, `modacondpred`, `medianacondpred`) are defined and applied to each time series. These functions seem to calculate different types of predictions (mean, mode, median, quantiles) for each time point in the series.

## Writing Predictions to Files:

- The results of these predictions are then written to different text files for further analysis or use.
